These data are generated at various resolutions\u2014ranging from bulk and single-cell to spatial transcriptomics\u2014and through diverse sequencing platforms, such as short-read and long-read technologies.  </p> <p>Effectively analyzing and integrating these multimodal and multi-resolution datasets presents both a substantial computational challenge and a transformative opportunity to decipher complex biological systems and disease mechanisms in humans and animals. This workshop aims to bring together researchers developing and applying cutting-edge computational algorithms for the integration, interpretation, and visualization of multimodal sequencing data.  </p> <p>By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, the workshop will promote the development of innovative computational strategies that advance biomedical discovery and translational medicine.</p>"},{"location":"#research-topics-included-in-the-workshop","title":"Research Topics Included in the Workshop","text":"<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Algorithms for integrative analysis of genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, metagenome, metabolome, etc.  </li> <li>Machine learning and deep learning approaches for multi-omics integration  </li> <li>Graph-based and network-driven models for multimodal biological data  </li> <li>Dimensionality reduction and representation learning for heterogeneous omics data  </li> <li>Computational tools for joint variant calling, gene regulation inference, and epigenetic state mapping  </li> <li>Multi-omics data harmonization across individuals, tissues, or timepoints  </li> <li>Applications in cancer genomics, neurogenetics, immunology, personalized medicine, and One Health  </li> <li>Benchmarking datasets and evaluation frameworks for multi-omics algorithms  </li> <li>Scalability and reproducibility in multimodal data analysis pipelines  </li> <li>Visualization techniques for integrated omics datasets  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#workshop-style","title":"Workshop Style","text":"<p>Hybrid.
