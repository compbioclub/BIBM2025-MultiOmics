**BIBM2025 Workshop - From Bulk to Single-Cell and Spatial: Computational Intelligence for Multimodal Sequencing Data**
---

## Introduction to Workshop  
The rapid advancement of genetic and epigenetic sequencing technologies has produced vast and heterogeneous biological datasets across multiple molecular layers, including the genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, metagenome, and metabolome. These data are generated at various resolutions—ranging from bulk and single-cell to spatial transcriptomics—and through diverse sequencing platforms, such as short-read and long-read technologies.  

Effectively analyzing and integrating these multimodal and multi-resolution datasets presents both a substantial computational challenge and a transformative opportunity to decipher complex biological systems and disease mechanisms in humans and animals. This workshop aims to bring together researchers developing and applying cutting-edge computational algorithms for the integration, interpretation, and visualization of multimodal sequencing data.  

By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, the workshop will promote the development of innovative computational strategies that advance biomedical discovery and translational medicine.
